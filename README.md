# fifa_player_2019

Data science project using a large scale data. I have used a csv file from Kaggle.com to analyze the data of foodball players all around the world in 2019. Jupyter Notebook was used as a developer environment. Using MiniConda, the project was implemented over Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The csv file was analyzed to find the difference between Value and Wage of a individual player. The data was shown by using Bokeh module.
